## Hi! 👋

I'm **Louis Birla**: Loop founder, a (mainly) web developer, and student with pretty ambitious goals. 🚀

I've got a portfolio at [birla.io](https://birla.io), and I'm building [Loop](https://loop.page), the platform for the next evolution of apps.

<!-- TODO: Fix the Loop summary -->

#### I've got interests in:
- 🖥️ Tech (of all kinds)
- 🌏 Worldbuilding (especially cultures & languages)
- 🎮 Gaming (especially strategy games)
- 🤔 Philosophy
