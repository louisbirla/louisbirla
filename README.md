## Hi! 👋

I'm **Louis Birla**, a web developer with pretty ambitious goals. 🚀

I've got a portfolio at [birla.io](https://birla.io), and I'm building [Loop](https://loop.page), the infinitely recursive knowledge base, social media, messenger, and whatever your mind can imagine, all built by free, open-sourced, ethical code.

#### I've got interests in:
- 🖥️ Tech (of all kinds)
- 🌏 Worldbuilding (especially cultures)
- 🎮 Gaming (especially strategy games)
- 🤔 Philosophy
